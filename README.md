Data is separated by treatments, numbered according to the treatments listed in the manuscript "Soybean Nutrition in a Novel, Single Nutrient Source Hydroponic Solution" 
by Cole et al. and submitted to the journal _Agronomy_ in December 2020 (see Table 1). For a full, description of treatments, see the manuscript.
An overview of treatments is given below:

1. Hoagland solution (Hoagland and Arnon, 1950)
2. single source nutrient solution with no pH adjustment
3. single source nutrient solution with pH adjustment via HCl
4. single source nutrient solution with pH adjustment via acetic acid
5. single source nutrient solution with pH adjustment via acetic acid and decreased Mg and Ca
6. single source nutrient solution with pH adjustment via acetic acid and decresaed Mg and Ca and increased Mn.

Spreadsheets are detailed below:

20 and 28 d Visual Ratings: Visual ratings at 20 and 28 d following methods indicated in the above manuscript.

32 d Harvest Data: Includes plant height (in), stem width (cm), and dried shoot and root biomass (g) at the 32 d harvest. 
Plant height and stem width include two observations per replicate.

53 d Harvest Data: Includes plant height (in), stem width (cm), plant and root visual ratigns and dried shoot and root
biomass (g) at the 53 d harvest.

20 and 53 d Harvest Nutrient Contents: nutrient contents for replicated macro and micro nutrients and consolidated total N
concentrations. Units are in either % or ppm as indicated.

pH Data: Includes data on each replicate's pH value before and after adjustment. Acid added is in mL of 
stock solutions and NaOH added is in grams.

Stats_Results: Includes outputs for the statistical analysis of the study.
